Plugin name: PHP 5.3.x &lt; 5.3.28 Multiple OpenSSL Vulnerabilities<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote host is 5.3.x prior to 5.3.28.  It is, therefore, potentially affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A flaw exists in the PHP OpenSSL extension's hostname     identity check when handling certificates that contain     hostnames with NULL bytes. An attacker could potentially     exploit this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks     to spoof SSL servers. Note that to exploit this issue,     an attacker would need to obtain a carefully-crafted     certificate signed by an authority that the client     trusts. (CVE-2013-4073)

  - A memory corruption flaw exists in the way the     openssl_x509_parse() function of the PHP OpenSSL     extension parsed X.509 certificates. A remote attacker     could use this flaw to provide a malicious, self-signed     certificate or a certificate signed by a trusted     authority to a PHP application using the aforementioned     function. This could cause the application to crash or     possibly allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code     with the privileges of the user running the PHP     interpreter. (CVE-2013-6420)

Note that this plugin does not attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities, but instead relies only on PHP's self-reported version number.

Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL/TLS EXPORT_RSA <font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host supports EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less than or equal to 512 bits. An attacker can factor a 512-bit RSA modulus in a short amount of time.

A man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session to use EXPORT_RSA cipher suites (e.g. CVE-2015-0204). Thus, it is recommended to remove support for weak cipher suites.
Fix Information: Reconfigure the service to remove support for EXPORT_RSA cipher suites.
Exploit: Exploits are available
CVE:  CVE-2015-0204

Plugin name: SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The server's X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.
Fix Information: Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Certificate Expiry<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: This plugin checks expiry dates of certificates associated with SSL- enabled services on the target and reports whether any have already expired.
Fix Information: Purchase or generate a new SSL certificate to replace the existing one.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Certificate with Wrong Hostname<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The commonName (CN) of the SSL certificate presented on this service is for a different machine.
Fix Information: Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL DROWN Attack Vulnerability (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption)<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack known as DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption). This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private key.
Fix Information: Disable SSLv2 and export grade cryptography cipher suites. Ensure that private keys are not used anywhere with server software that supports SSLv2 connections.
Exploit: Exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Self-Signed Certificate<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host. 

Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.
Fix Information: Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.
Fix Information: Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.
Exploit: Exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws. An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC'S definition of 'strong cryptography'.
Fix Information: Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.1 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Weak Cipher Suites Supported<font color="red">[--MANDATORY--]</font>
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer weak encryption. 

Note: This is considerably easier to exploit if the attacker is on the same physical network.
Fix Information: Reconfigure the affected application, if possible to avoid the use of weak ciphers.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: POP3 Cleartext Logins Permitted
Risk factor: Low
Description: The remote host is running a POP3 daemon that allows cleartext logins over unencrypted connections. An attacker can uncover user names and passwords by sniffing traffic to the POP3 daemon if a less secure authentication mechanism (eg, USER command, AUTH PLAIN, AUTH LOGIN) is used.
Fix Information: Contact your vendor for a fix or encrypt traffic with SSL / TLS using stunnel.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SMTP Service Cleartext Login Permitted
Risk factor: Low
Description: The remote host is running an SMTP server that advertises that it allows cleartext logins over unencrypted connections.  An attacker may be able to uncover user names and passwords by sniffing traffic to the server if a less secure authentication mechanism (i.e.  LOGIN or PLAIN) is used.
Fix Information: Configure the service to support less secure authentication mechanisms only over an encrypted channel.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSH Server CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled
Risk factor: Low
Description: The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption.  This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext. 

Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server and does not check for vulnerable software versions.
Fix Information: Contact the vendor or consult product documentation to disable CBC mode cipher encryption, and enable CTR or GCM cipher mode encryption.
Exploit: No known exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSH Weak MAC Algorithms Enabled
Risk factor: Low
Description: The remote SSH server is configured to allow either MD5 or 96-bit MAC algorithms, both of which are considered weak.

Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server, and it does not check for vulnerable software versions.
Fix Information: Contact the vendor or consult product documentation to disable MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms.
Exploit: No known exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Anonymous Cipher Suites Supported
Risk factor: Low
Description: The remote host supports the use of anonymous SSL ciphers.  While this enables an administrator to set up a service that encrypts traffic without having to generate and configure SSL certificates, it offers no way to verify the remote host's identity and renders the service vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Note: This is considerably easier to exploit if the attacker is on the same physical network.
Fix Information: Reconfigure the affected application if possible to avoid use of weak ciphers.
Exploit: Exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL RC4 Cipher Suites Supported (Bar Mitzvah)
Risk factor: Low
Description: The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites.
The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.

If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.
Fix Information: Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers. Consider using TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM suites subject to browser and web server support.
Exploit: No known exploits are available
CVE: None
