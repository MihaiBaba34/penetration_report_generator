Plugin name: User credentials are sent in clear text[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description: User credentials are transmitted over an unencrypted channel. This information should always be transferred via an encrypted channel (HTTPS) to avoid being intercepted by malicious users.
Fix Information: A third party may be able to read the user credentials by intercepting an unencrypted HTTP connection.
CVE: CWE-310

Plugin name: HTML form without CSRF protection[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description:  This alert may be a false positive, manual confirmation is required.
Cross-site request forgery, also known as a one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.

Acunetix WVS found a HTML form with no apparent CSRF protection implemented. Consult details for more information about the affected HTML form.
Fix Information: An attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker''s choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, this can compromise the entire web application.
CVE: CWE-352

Plugin name: Vulnerable Javascript library[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description: You are using a vulnerable Javascript library. One or more vulnerabilities were reported for this version of the Javascript library. Consult Attack details and Web References for more information about the affected library and the vulnerabilities that were reported.

CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Basic authentication over HTTP[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description: In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request. 

This directory is protected using Basic Authentication over an HTTP connection. With Basic Authentication the user credentials are sent as cleartext and because HTTPS is not used, they are vulnerable to packet sniffing.
Fix Information: User credentials are sent as cleartext and are vulnerable to packet sniffing.
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Clickjacking: X-Frame-Options header missing 
Risk factor: Low
Description: Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages. 
The server didn't return an X-Frame-Options header which means that this website could be at risk of a clickjacking attack. The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

Fix Information: The impact depends on the affected web application. 
CVE: CWE-693

Plugin name: OPTIONS method is enabled 
Risk factor: Low
Description: HTTP OPTIONS method is enabled on this web server. The OPTIONS method provides a list of the methods that are supported by the web server, it represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI.
Fix Information: The OPTIONS method may expose sensitive information that may help an malicious user to prepare more advanced attacks.
CVE: CWE-200

Plugin name: Possible virtual host found 
Risk factor: Low
Description: Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server (or pool of servers). This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processor cycles, without requiring all services provided to use the same host name. 
This web server is responding differently when the Host header is manipulated and various common virtual hosts are tested. This could indicate there is a Virtual Host present.
Fix Information: Possible sensitive information disclosure.
CVE: CWE-200

Plugin name: Login page password-guessing attack 
Risk factor: Low
Description: A common threat web developers face is a password-guessing attack known as a brute force attack. A brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works. 

This login page doesn't have any protection against password-guessing attacks (brute force attacks). It's recommended to implement some type of account lockout after a defined number of incorrect password attempts. Consult Web references for more information about fixing this problem.
Fix Information: An attacker may attempt to discover a weak password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until it discovers the one correct combination that works.
CVE: CWE-307

Plugin name: Insecure response with wildcard '*' in Access-Control-Allow-Origin 
Risk factor: Low
Description: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicates whether a resource can be shared based by returning the value of the Origin request header, &quot;*&quot;, or &quot;null&quot; in the response. 
If a website responds with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * the requested resource allows sharing with every origin. Therefore, any website can make XHR (XMLHTTPRequest) requests to your site and access the responses. It's not recommended to use the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header.
Fix Information: Any website can make XHR requests to your site and access the responses.
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Possible sensitive directories 
Risk factor: Low
Description: A possible sensitive directory has been found. This directory is not directly linked from the website.This check looks for common sensitive resources like backup directories, database dumps, administration pages, temporary directories. Each one of these directories could help an attacker to learn more about his target.
Fix Information: This directory may expose sensitive information that could help a malicious user to prepare more advanced attacks.
CVE: CWE-200

Plugin name: Cookie(s) without HttpOnly flag set 
Risk factor: Low
Description: This cookie does not have the HTTPOnly flag set. When a cookie is set with the HTTPOnly flag, it instructs the browser that the cookie can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side scripts. This is an important security protection for session cookies.
Fix Information: None
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Password type input with auto-complete enabled 
Risk factor: Informational
Description: When a new name and password is entered in a form and the form is submitted, the browser asks if the password should be saved.Thereafter when the form is displayed, the name and password are filled in automatically or are completed as the name is entered. An attacker with local access could obtain the cleartext password from the browser cache.
Fix Information: Possible sensitive information disclosure.

Plugin name: Open Port Re-check
Risk factor: Informational
Description: One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.
Fix Information: - Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan
