Exploit: No
CVE: CVE-2015-0204

Plugin name: SSL/TLS RC4 Cipher Suites Supported[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host allows the use of RC4 cipher suites. The RC4 cipher generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes is flawed to allow small biases into the stream, decreasing its randomness. If plaintext is encrypted over and over and an attacker is able to obtain millions of ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to retrieve the plaintext from the stream.
Fix Information: If possible, disable the use of RC4 ciphers in the application or its host operating system.
Exploit: No
CVE: CVE-2013-2566

Plugin name: SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The server's X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.
Fix Information: Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.

Plugin name: SSL DROWN Attack Vulnerability (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption)[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack known as DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption). This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private key.
Fix Information: Disable SSLv2 and export grade cryptography cipher suites. Ensure that private keys are not used anywhere with server software that supports SSLv2 connections.
Exploit: Exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Self-Signed Certificate[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host. 

Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.
Fix Information: Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSLv2 Detected[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2 has been detected.  This protocol is known to have cryptographic weaknesses as well as other exploitable vulnerabilities.
Fix Information: Ensure that applications or services are configured to reject SSL version 2 communications.

Note:  Most implementations of SSL will provide support for all versions of the protocol.  It is up to the application to decide what versions of the protocol it will support and/or refuse. When an SSL connection is negotiated, the client first asks the server application if it will support a certain version of the protocol.  This is known as the 'handshake'. If the server responds that the version is supported, then credentials/keys are exchanged to complete the connection.

Some server applications, such as IIS, will reject the initial handshake based on its protocol configuration. Other server applications attempt to exchange keys before determining if it will support the requested version of the SSL protocol. 

Since SSLv2 exploits are normally based on the initial handshake, Retina relies on the response from the handshake request to ascertain a potential vulnerability. Because of this, an application that is configured to reject SSLv2 could still report as vulnerable.
Exploit: No
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSLv3 Fallback Vulnerability (POODLE)[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The SSL protocol 3.0 uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack, aka the 'POODLE' issue.
Fix Information: Disable the use of the SSLv3 protocol if possible. If compatibility with legacy systems is an issue, attempt to update your TLS implementation to one which can leverage TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, if available.
Exploit: No
CVE: CVE-2014-3566

Plugin name: SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.
Fix Information: Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.
Exploit: Exploits are available
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection[--MANDATORY--]
Risk factor: Medium
Description: The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws. An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC'S definition of 'strong cryptography'.
Fix Information: Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.1 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.
Exploit: ---
CVE: None

Exploit: No
CVE: None

Plugin name: SSL RC4 Cipher Suites Supported (Bar Mitzvah)
Risk factor: Low
Description: The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites.
The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.

If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.
Fix Information: Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers. Consider using TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM suites subject to browser and web server support.
