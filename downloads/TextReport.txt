Plugin name: Cross site scripting (verified)[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: High
Description: This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.
Fix Information: Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user in order to gather data from them.
An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account, impersonating the user.
It is also possible to modify the content of the page presented to the user.
CVE: CWE-79

Plugin name: nginx SPDY heap buffer overflow[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: High
Description: A heap-based buffer overflow in the SPDY implementation in nginx 1.3.15 before 1.4.7 and 1.5.x before 1.5.12 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request. The problem affects nginx compiled with the ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default) and without --with-debug configure option, if the &quot;spdy&quot; option of the &quot;listen&quot; directive is used in a configuration file.
Fix Information: An attacker can cause a heap memory buffer overflow in a worker process by using a specially crafted request, potentially
resulting in arbitrary code execution 
CVE: CWE-122

Plugin name: Weak password[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: High
Description: This page is using a weak password. Acunetix WVS was able to guess the credentials required to access this page. A weak password is short, common, a system default, or something that could be rapidly guessed by executing a brute force attack using a subset of all possible passwords, such as words in the dictionary, proper names, words based on the user name or common variations on these themes.
Fix Information: An attacker may access the contents of the password-protected page.
CVE: CWE-200

Plugin name: XML external entity injection[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: High
Description: XML supports a facility known as &quot;external entities&quot;, which instruct an XML processor to retrieve and perform an inline include of XML located at a particular  URI. An external XML entity can be used to append or modify the document type declaration (DTD) associated with an XML document.  An  external XML entity can also be used to include XML within the  content of an XML document. Now assume that the XML processor parses data originating from a source under attacker control. Most of the time the processor will not be validating, but it MAY include the replacement text thus initiating an unexpected file open operation, or HTTP transfer, or whatever system ids the XML
 processor knows how to access. below is a sample XML document that will use this functionality to include the contents of a local file (/etc/passwd)

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE acunetix [
  &lt;!ENTITY acunetixent SYSTEM &quot;file:///etc/passwd&quot;&gt;
]&gt;
&lt;xxx&gt;&amp;acunetixent;&lt;/xxx&gt;

Fix Information: Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via http(s) requests.
CVE: CWE-611

Plugin name: Basic authentication over HTTP[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description: In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request. 

This directory is protected using Basic Authentication over an HTTP connection. With Basic Authentication the user credentials are sent as cleartext and because HTTPS is not used, they are vulnerable to packet sniffing.
Fix Information: User credentials are sent as cleartext and are vulnerable to packet sniffing.
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: HTML form without CSRF protection[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description:  This alert may be a false positive, manual confirmation is required.
Cross-site request forgery, also known as a one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.

Acunetix WVS found a HTML form with no apparent CSRF protection implemented. Consult details for more information about the affected HTML form.
Fix Information: An attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker''s choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, this can compromise the entire web application.
CVE: CWE-352

Plugin name: User credentials are sent in clear text[--MANDATORY--] 
Risk factor: Medium
Description: User credentials are transmitted over an unencrypted channel. This information should always be transferred via an encrypted channel (HTTPS) to avoid being intercepted by malicious users.
Fix Information: A third party may be able to read the user credentials by intercepting an unencrypted HTTP connection.
CVE: CWE-310

Plugin name: Vulnerable Javascript library[--MANDATORY--]

Fix Information: Consult Web References for more information.
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Clickjacking: X-Frame-Options header missing 
Risk factor: Low
Description: Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages. 
The server didn't return an X-Frame-Options header which means that this website could be at risk of a clickjacking attack. The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

Fix Information: The impact depends on the affected web application. 
CVE: CWE-693

Plugin name: Cookie(s) without HttpOnly flag set 
Risk factor: Low
Description: This cookie does not have the HTTPOnly flag set. When a cookie is set with the HTTPOnly flag, it instructs the browser that the cookie can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side scripts. This is an important security protection for session cookies.
Fix Information: None
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Insecure response with wildcard '*' in Access-Control-Allow-Origin 
Risk factor: Low
Description: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicates whether a resource can be shared based by returning the value of the Origin request header, &quot;*&quot;, or &quot;null&quot; in the response. 
If a website responds with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * the requested resource allows sharing with every origin. Therefore, any website can make XHR (XMLHTTPRequest) requests to your site and access the responses. It's not recommended to use the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header.
Fix Information: Any website can make XHR requests to your site and access the responses.
CVE: CWE-16

Plugin name: Login page password-guessing attack 
Risk factor: Low
Description: A common threat web developers face is a password-guessing attack known as a brute force attack. A brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works. 

This login page doesn't have any protection against password-guessing attacks (brute force attacks). It's recommended to implement some type of account lockout after a defined number of incorrect password attempts. Consult Web references for more information about fixing this problem.
Fix Information: An attacker may attempt to discover a weak password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until it discovers the one correct combination that works.
CVE: CWE-307

Plugin name: OPTIONS method is enabled 
Risk factor: Low
Description: HTTP OPTIONS method is enabled on this web server. The OPTIONS method provides a list of the methods that are supported by the web server, it represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI.
Fix Information: The OPTIONS method may expose sensitive information that may help an malicious user to prepare more advanced attacks.

Fix Information: This directory may expose sensitive information that could help a malicious user to prepare more advanced attacks.
CVE: CWE-200

Plugin name: Possible virtual host found 
Risk factor: Low
Description: Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server (or pool of servers). This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processor cycles, without requiring all services provided to use the same host name. 
This web server is responding differently when the Host header is manipulated and various common virtual hosts are tested. This could indicate there is a Virtual Host present.
Fix Information: Possible sensitive information disclosure.
CVE: CWE-200

Plugin name: Password type input with auto-complete enabled 
Risk factor: Informational
Description: When a new name and password is entered in a form and the form is submitted, the browser asks if the password should be saved.Thereafter when the form is displayed, the name and password are filled in automatically or are completed as the name is entered. An attacker with local access could obtain the cleartext password from the browser cache.
