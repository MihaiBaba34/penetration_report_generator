       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else.

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>

<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.<br/><br/>
Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs.

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message.

Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks.

If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.<br/><br/>
Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.<br/><br/>
Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[This script is possibly vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.<br/><br/>
SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and doesn't properly filter out dangerous characters. <br/> <br/> This is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet.  Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from  SQL Injection Attacks by Example - http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html</i>
<h2>SQL injection mitigations</h2>

<p>We believe that web application developers often simply do not think about &quot;surprise inputs&quot;, but security people do (including the bad guys), so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.</p>

<h2>Sanitize the input</h2>
<p>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out &quot;bad stuff&quot;, such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided attempt. Though it's easy to point out some dangerous characters, it's harder to point to all of them.</p>
<p>The language of the web is full of special characters and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all &quot;bad stuff&quot; are unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than &quot;remove known bad data&quot;, it's better to &quot;remove everything but known good data&quot;: this distinction is crucial. Since - in our example - an email address can contain only these characters: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789
    @.-_+
</pre></code>

<p>There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into the database. </p>

<p>Be aware that &quot;sanitizing the input&quot; doesn't mean merely &quot;remove the quotes&quot;, because even &quot;regular&quot; characters can be troublesome. In an example where an integer ID value is being compared against the user input (say, a numeric PIN): </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM table
     WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1;  -- Boom! Always matches!
</pre></code>
<p>In practice, however, this approach is highly limited because there are so few fields for which it's possible to outright exclude many of the dangerous characters. For &quot;dates&quot; or &quot;email addresses&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; it may have merit, but for any kind of real application, one simply cannot avoid the other mitigations. </p>

<h2>Escape/Quotesafe the input</h2>
<p>Even if one might be able to sanitize a phone number or email address, one cannot take this approach with a &quot;name&quot; field lest one wishes to exclude the likes of Bill O'Reilly from one's application: a quote is simply a valid character for this field.</p>
<p>One includes an actual single quote in an SQL string by putting two of them together, so this suggests the obvious - but wrong! - technique of preprocessing every string to replicate the single quotes:</p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = 'Bill O''Reilly';  -- works OK
</pre></code>    
<p>However, this naive approach can be beaten because most databases support other string escape mechanisms. MySQL, for instance, also permits \' to escape a quote, so after input of \'; DROP TABLE users; -- is &quot;protected&quot; by doubling the quotes, we get: </p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">
    SELECT fieldlist
      FROM customers
     WHERE name = '\''; DROP TABLE users; --';  -- Boom!
</pre></code>    
<p>The expression '\'' is a complete string (containing just one single quote), and the usual SQL shenanigans follow. It doesn't stop with backslashes either: there is Unicode, other encodings, and parsing oddities all hiding in the weeds to trip up the application designer.</p>
<p>Getting quotes right is notoriously difficult, which is why many database interface languages provide a function that does it for you. When the same internal code is used for &quot;string quoting&quot; and &quot;string parsing&quot;, it's much more likely that the process will be done properly and safely.</p>
<p>Some examples are the MySQL function <b>mysql_real_escape_string()</b> and perl DBD method <b>$dbh-&gt;quote($value)</b>. These methods must be used. </p>

<h2>Use bound parameters (the PREPARE statement)</h2>
<p>Though quotesafing is a good mechanism, we're still in the area of &quot;considering user input as SQL&quot;, and a much better approach exists: bound parameters, which are supported by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique, an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark for each parameter - and it's compiled (&quot;prepared&quot;, in SQL parlance) into an internal form. Later, this prepared query is &quot;executed&quot; with a list of parameters: </p>

<b>Example in perl</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = ?;&quot;);
    $sth-&gt;execute($email);
</pre></code> 
<p>Thanks to Stefan Wagner, this demonstrates bound parameters in Java: </p>

<b>Insecure version</b>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    Statement s = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(&quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = &quot;
                                 + formField); // *boom*
</pre></code> 

<p><b>Secure version</b></p>
<code><pre wrap="virtual">    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
        &quot;SELECT email FROM member WHERE name = ?&quot;);
    ps.setString(1, formField);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
</pre></code> 

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

<p>Here, $email is the data obtained from the user's form, and it is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's &quot;just data&quot;. There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application is be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.</p>
 
<p>There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed once), but this is minor compared to the enormous security benefits. This is probably the single most important step one can take to secure a web application. </p>

<h2>Limit database permissions and segregate users</h2>
<p>In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not in the context of a logged-in user: &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;send me password&quot;. The web application ought to use a database connection with the most limited rights possible: query-only access to the members table, and no access to any other table.</p>
<p>The effect here is that even a &quot;successful&quot; SQL injection attack is going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able to do the UPDATE request that ultimately granted us access, so we'd have had to resort to other avenues.</p>
<p>Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session to a database connection with more rights.</p>
<p>It should go almost without saying that sa rights should never be used for any web-based application.</p>

<h2>Use stored procedures for database access</h2>
<p>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for performing access on the application's behalf, which can eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures themselves are written properly). </p>
<p>By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete, etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the &quot;add new order&quot; procedure might reject that order if the customer were over his credit limit). </p>
<p>For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit, but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's going to be more robust and easier to maintain. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>it's always possible to write a stored procedure that itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides no protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound variables that provide this protection. </p>

<h2>Isolate the webserver</h2>
<p>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One ought to design the network infrastructure to assume that the bad guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things. </p>
<p>For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited pinholes &quot;inside&quot; the network means that even getting complete control of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder. </p>

<h2>Configure error reporting</h2>
<p>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes developer debugging information, and this cannot be shown to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax error involved. </p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal users. </p>]]></DetailedInformation>

Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.]]></Description>
       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<i>Quote from The Cross Site Scripting FAQ - http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml </i> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Websites today are more complex than ever, containing a lot of dynamic content making the experience for the user more enjoyable. Dynamic content is achieved through the use of web applications which can deliver different output to a user depending on their settings and needs. Dynamic websites suffer from a threat that static websites don't, called &quot;Cross Site Scripting&quot; (or XSS dubbed by other security professionals). Currently small informational tidbits about Cross Site Scripting holes exist but none really explain them to an average person or administrator. This FAQ was written to provide a better understanding of this emerging threat, and to give guidance on detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>&quot;What is Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting (also known as XSS) occurs when a web application gathers malicious data from a user. The data is usually gathered in the form of a hyperlink which contains malicious content within it. The user will most likely click on this link from another website, instant message, or simply just reading a web board or email message. Usually the attacker will encode the malicious portion of the link to the site in HEX (or other encoding methods) so the request is less suspicious looking to the user when clicked on. After the data is collected by the web application, it creates an output page for the user containing the malicious data that was originally sent to it, but in a manner to make it appear as valid content from the website. Many popular guestbook and forum programs allow users to submit posts with html and javascript embedded in them. If for example I was logged in as &quot;john&quot; and read a message by &quot;joe&quot; that contained malicious javascript in it, then it may be possible for &quot;joe&quot; to hijack my session just by reading his bulletin board post. Further details on how attacks like this are accomplished via &quot;cookie theft&quot; are explained in detail below.</p>

<h2>&quot;What does XSS and CSS mean?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often people refer to Cross Site Scripting as CSS. There has been a lot of confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and cross site scripting. Some security people refer to Cross Site Scripting as XSS. If you hear someone say &quot;I found a XSS hole&quot;, they are talking about Cross Site Scripting for certain.</p>


<h2>&quot;What are the threats of Cross Site Scripting?&quot;</h2>

<p>Often attackers will inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user (Read below for further details) in order to gather data from them. Everything from account hijacking, changing of user settings, cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising is possible. New malicious uses are being found every day for XSS attacks. The post below by Brett Moore brings up a good point with regard to &quot;Denial Of Service&quot;, and potential &quot;auto-attacking&quot; of hosts if a user simply reads a post on a message board.</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a vendor?&quot;</h2>

<p>This is a simple answer. Never trust user input and always filter metacharacters. This will eliminate the majority of XSS attacks. Converting &lt; and &gt; to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; is also suggested when it comes to script output. Remember XSS holes can be damaging and costly to your business if abused. Often attackers will disclose these holes to the public, which can erode customer and public confidence in the security and privacy of your organization's site. Filtering &lt; and &gt; alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to &amp;#40; and &amp;#41;, and also # and &amp; by translating them to &amp;#35 (#) and &amp;#38 (&amp;).</p>

<h2>&quot;What can I do to protect myself as a user?&quot;</h2>

<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as a user is to only follow links from the main website you wish to view. If you visit one website and it links to CNN for example, instead of clicking on it visit CNN's main site and use its search engine to find the content. This will probably eliminate ninety percent of the problem. Sometimes XSS can be executed automatically when you open an email, email attachment, read a guestbook, or bulletin board post. If you plan on opening an email, or reading a post on a public board from a person you don't know BE CAREFUL. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to turn off Javascript in your browser settings. In IE turn your security settings to high. This can prevent cookie theft, and in general is a safer thing to do.</p>

<h2>&quot;How common are XSS holes?&quot;</h2>

<p>Cross site scripting holes are gaining popularity among hackers as easy holes to find in large websites. Websites from FBI.gov, CNN.com, Time.com, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple computer, Microsoft, Zdnet, Wired, and Newsbytes have all had one form or another of XSS bugs.</p>

<p>Every month roughly 10-25 XSS holes are found in commercial products and advisories are published explaining the threat.</p>


<h2>&quot;Does encryption protect me?&quot;</h2>

<p>Websites that use SSL (https) are in no way more protected than websites that are not encrypted. The web applications work the same way as before, except the attack is taking place in an encrypted connection. People often think that because they see the lock on their browser it means everything is secure. This just isn't the case.</p>


<h2>&quot;Can XSS holes allow command execution?&quot;</h2>

<p>XSS holes can allow Javascript insertion, which may allow for limited execution. If an attacker were to exploit a browser flaw (browser hole) it could then be possible to execute commands on the client's side. If command execution were possible it would only be possible on the client side. In simple terms XSS holes can be used to help exploit other holes that may exist in your browser.</p>


<h2>&quot;What if I don't feel like fixing a CSS/XSS Hole?&quot;</h2>

<p>By not fixing an XSS hole this could allow possible user account compromise in portions of your site as they get added or updated. Cross Site Scripting has been found in various large sites recently and have been widely publicized. Left unrepaired, someone may discover it and publish a warning about your company. This may damage your company's reputation, depicting it as being lax on security matters. This of course also sends the message to your clients that you aren't dealing with every problem that arises, which turns into a trust issue. If your client doesn't trust you why would they wish to do business with you?</p>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<h2>How to disable directory listings</h2> <ul> <li>The easiest way to disable directory listing is to create an index file. The name of the index file depends on the web server configuration. On Apache is called index.htm, index.html. On IIS is named default.asp, default.aspx, default.htm.</li> <li>On IIS directory listings are disabled by default.</li> <li>For Apache you need to edit the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf) or create an .htaccess file. In the configuration file you will have the definition of the directory. Something like   <pre wrap="virtual"><code>&lt;Directory  /directoryname/subdirectory&gt; Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ... &lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre> To disable directory listing for that directory you need to remove the 'Indexes' option. </li> </ul>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<h2>How to disable directory listings</h2> <ul> <li>The easiest way to disable directory listing is to create an index file. The name of the index file depends on the web server configuration. On Apache is called index.htm, index.html. On IIS is named default.asp, default.aspx, default.htm.</li> <li>On IIS directory listings are disabled by default.</li> <li>For Apache you need to edit the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf) or create an .htaccess file. In the configuration file you will have the definition of the directory. Something like   <pre wrap="virtual"><code>&lt;Directory  /directoryname/subdirectory&gt; Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ... &lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre> To disable directory listing for that directory you need to remove the 'Indexes' option. </li> </ul>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<h2>How to disable directory listings</h2> <ul> <li>The easiest way to disable directory listing is to create an index file. The name of the index file depends on the web server configuration. On Apache is called index.htm, index.html. On IIS is named default.asp, default.aspx, default.htm.</li> <li>On IIS directory listings are disabled by default.</li> <li>For Apache you need to edit the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf) or create an .htaccess file. In the configuration file you will have the definition of the directory. Something like   <pre wrap="virtual"><code>&lt;Directory  /directoryname/subdirectory&gt; Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ... &lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre> To disable directory listing for that directory you need to remove the 'Indexes' option. </li> </ul>]]></DetailedInformation>

       <Description><![CDATA[The open_basedir configuration directive will limit the files that can be opened by PHP to the specified directory-tree. When a script tries to open a file with, for example, fopen() or gzopen(), the location of the file is checked. When the file is outside the specified directory-tree, PHP will refuse to open it. open_basedir is a good protection against remote file inclusion vulnerabilities. For a remote attacker it is not possible to break out of the open_basedir restrictions if he is only able to inject the name of a file to be included. Therefore the number of files he will be able to include with such a local file include vulnerability is limited.]]></Description>

       <DetailedInformation><![CDATA[<h2>How to disable directory listings</h2> <ul> <li>The easiest way to disable directory listing is to create an index file. The name of the index file depends on the web server configuration. On Apache is called index.htm, index.html. On IIS is named default.asp, default.aspx, default.htm.</li> <li>On IIS directory listings are disabled by default.</li> <li>For Apache you need to edit the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf) or create an .htaccess file. In the configuration file you will have the definition of the directory. Something like   <pre wrap="virtual"><code>&lt;Directory  /directoryname/subdirectory&gt; Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ... &lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre> To disable directory listing for that directory you need to remove the 'Indexes' option. </li> </ul>]]></DetailedInformation>
